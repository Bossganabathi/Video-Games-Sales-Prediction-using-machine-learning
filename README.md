# Video-Games-Sales-Prediction-using-machine-learning
This project is basically video game sales prediction by using machine learning method. I'm using linear regression model to predict the sales. The are North America sales, Japan sales, Europe sales and others. By these features we predict the global sales. For this project regression method is more suitable because the sales is continues values so linear regression is more suitable. To test the accuracy of the model I'm using R2 method, Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The dataset taken from Kaggle.com
